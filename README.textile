h1. CodeIgniter Head Library

The Head Library is a CodeIgniter library that allows for an unobtrusive way to create the head tag content for an HTML document from the controller using both dynamic info and site-wide configurations. The Head Library allows you to include resources for your pages logically through the controller. Before you load your page, just call the render_head function and the head tag content is generated.

This Head Library comes with support for packages of items for easy loading, as well as special considerations for jQuery and Google Analytics.
